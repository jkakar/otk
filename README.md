OpenToken (OTK) is a format for the lightweight, secure,
cross-application exchange of key-value pairs between applications
that use HTTP as the transport protocol.  The format is designed
primarily for use as an HTTP cookie or query parameter, but can also
be used in other scenarios that require a compact, application-neutral
token.

This implementation is based on the draft specification here:
